### Setting Up

<sub>[home](../README.md#user-content-ue4-lighting) â€¢ [next](../prep/README.md#user-content-lighting-prep)</sub>

![](../images/line3.png)

We will be working with a level that has already been gray blocked and modelled. It is a finished level minus the lighting. This was created by the team at Unreal and included in their Content Example project in UE4 (they have removed it in the latest version). You will also have a third person character to move through the environment to check your work.

| `required.software`\|`UE5 Lighting`| 
| :--- |
| :floppy_disk: &nbsp; &nbsp; You will need to install the latest version of _UE4 5.0.X_ by downloading the [Epic Games Launcher](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/download). You will also need a [P4V](https://www.perforce.com/downloads/helix-visual-client-p4v) account which is free to sign up for as we will be using version control. Lets make sure you can see hidden folders. On the PC follow these [Windows 10 Turn on Hidden Folders](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028316/windows-view-hidden-files-and-folders-in-windows-10) directions.

##### `Step 1.`\|`ITL`|:small_blue_diamond:

If you have not installed the required software go and add [Epic Games Launcher](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/download). Make sure the version of Unreal you are installed  has a 5.0.X in its name so that we know this walk through will be compatible with your version of Unreal. This will not work in UE4.

##### `Step 2.`\|`ITL`|:small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: 

Make sure you have room for another 4 gigabytes (starter plus your added work) of space on your computer. Navigate to [UE5-Lighting-Starter](https://github.com/LSU-UE5/UE5-Lighting-Starter) and press the <kbd>Code Button</kbd> and select **Download ZIP**. It will take a while so try and do this on your best internet connection available to you. The file is roughly ~2 gigabytes.

##### `Step 6.`\|`ITL`| :small_orange_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Edit the README.md file in a text editor and add your name and a message (in my case it is a reminder that I will complete it at the end!).

##### `Step 9.`\|`ITL`| :small_orange_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Open up **UE5Lighting.uproject**. The project should load up in the Room/Level **UnlitLevel**. It should look like a pitch black room as there are no lights. 

![pitch black game screen](images/emptyLevel.png)

![](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 10.`\|`ITL`| :large_blue_diamond:

You will see a dark room that has not been lit. To see what is going on swtich to **Unlit** mode. Next page we will start lighting the scene from scratch.

##### `Step 11.`\|`ITL`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: 

Lets look at what is included in this project. We have a **Blocking Volumes** folder that contains invisible meshes. These are collision volumes with no visible geometry. They are used to stop players from entering areas the designer doesn't want them to go in. Select all of the  **BlockingVolumes** and press the <kbd>F</kbd> key to focus on it. Notice that is is blocking the player from jumping outside the unblocked windows and can't exit the building.

##### `Step 12.`\|`ITL`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: 

The **Static Meshes** folder contains all the static meshes for the level.

##### `Step 13.`\|`ITL`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:  :small_blue_diamond: 

In the **Outliner | Ground** folder we have a landscape and ocean water.  We are going to be on an island in the middle of the sea!

##### `Step 14.`\|`ITL`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:  :small_blue_diamond: 

Our player will start on the outside terrace of this building.  This is where the level begins when we start the level.

![player start node](images/playerStart.png)

![](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 15.`\|`ITL`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_orange_diamond: 

Open up **Settings | Project Settings | Maps and Modes**. It will start the editor and full game in the level `Unlit Level`. This is the dark room we are in. We also have **GameModeBase** which is the default gamemode for the entire project. This will not load up our custom third person character.  It would have a first person controller.  But it is the **World Settings** that loads up the custom game mode.

##### `Step 16.`\|`ITL`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_orange_diamond:   :small_blue_diamond: 

The **Game Mode** loads up the **Blueprints | MyGameLDDemo** that the **PlayerStart** object launches the player in the front terrace. The **Blueprints** folder also contains **ThirdPersonCharacter** which is the **UE5** mannequin that we will control in the game. This character blueprint is the **Default Pawn** in the gamemode blueprint.

Select the **File | Save All** then press the <kbd>Source Control</kbd> button and select **Submit Content**.  If you are prompted, select **Check Out** for all items that are not checked out of source control. Update the **Changelist Description** message and with the latest changes.
